\arguments{
\item{resultMat}{Tibble the simulation results}

\item{nSim}{Integer Predictions and counts for the first nSim simulations}

\item{xlim}{Real max and min for plot}

\item{ylim}{Real max and min for plot}

\item{budg1}{Integer which column of percent budget to make plot for x-axis}

\item{budg2}{Integer which column of percent budget to make plot for y-axis}

\item{binMeanContrast}{Numeric a higher value makes the peak stand out more}

\item{plotMn}{Logical if TRUE, plot mean of gain for bin not bin counts}

the most simulations were run}
